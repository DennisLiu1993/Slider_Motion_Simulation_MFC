# A project using MFC to demonstrate the concept of CPaintDC structure and timer, and flexibly utilize it to simulate the motion of crank-slider.
In this project, users can set parameters, such as rod length, initial distance of crank from the origin, angle acceleration, etc., to show motion in different situation.
Also, user are allowed to stop the motion at any moment.
